    projects:
        - not a small set of files
        - not a single file
        - size is large
        - multiple files
        - multiple people working on the same project
        - how do we track changes in the project files?
        - who, when, what, why, how?
        - how to record the changes?

git 
     - Source Code Management (SCM) 
        - Version Control System (VCS)
     SCM 
        - application
        - initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005
        - Unix is multi-user operating system
        - multiple people can work on the same files
        - to track changes in the files in unix 
        - created the git application
        - track changes in the files, record who made the changes, when the changes were made, what changes were made, why the changes were made, and how the changes were made

        - git is a distributed version control system
        - server - multiple clients(developers)
        - client - clone - local copy of the repository
        - work in their local copy- changes - version using commit command - push to the server
        - git is not going to store the entire file.
        - record the changes in the file
        - local repository - .git directory
