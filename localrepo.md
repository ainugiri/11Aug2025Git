SCM - to track changes in the project files

Local Directory
    - set of files.
    - changes in the files
    - is it possible to track changes in the files?
    - Saving the doc -> in memory, update the file. 

git 
   - scm tool
   - if i want to track changes in the files, i can use git.
   - create a local repository, git init
   - git appl -> track the changes in the files
   - git add <file>
   - added to staging area -> untracked -> tracked
   - Once you made a set of changes, you can commit the changes, that is called as versioning.
   - git commit -m "message"
   - 7letter hash code -> commit id
